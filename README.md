  “Technology & The Body: A non-invasive, Inexpensive Prosthetic Prototype” is a project with the goal of investigating the feasibility of developing an inexpensive,
  environmentally friendly, prosthetic arm alternative by using the United Nations: Sustainable Development Goals as the core foundations to the development of the project,
  taking into account several considerations such as “Goal 1: No Poverty”, ”Goal 3: Good Health & Well-being”, “Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities” , “Goal 14: Life Below Water”
  and “Goal 15: Life On  Land”.
  The Intention for this project is to use Inexpensive, easily sourced equipment so that anybody may reproduce the works.
